# Zelun Scheduler

The easiest way to schedule, automate, and manage bulk video uploads for YouTube and TikTok.

## What Is Zelun Scheduler?

Zelun Scheduler is a streamlined tool designed to automate posting workflows for creators who work with large volumes of content. Instead of uploading every video manually, the platform allows you to upload, schedule, and organize multiple videos at once, giving you full control over publishing times and distribution.

Whether you manage several content batches per week or want a predictable publishing routine, Zelun Scheduler saves time and eliminates repetitive manual steps.

## Key Features

**Bulk Uploads**  
Upload multiple videos at once and reduce the time wasted in uploading files one by one.

**Cross-Platform Scheduling**  
Schedule content for YouTube and TikTok using a single dashboard.

**Automated Publishing**  
Set the exact date and time for each video to go live, allowing you to plan days or weeks ahead.

**Content Organization**  
Group, queue, and reorder your videos easily to maintain a clear posting flow.

**Smart Queueing**  
Ensure that no video overlaps unintentionally by assigning automatic delays or day-by-day posting slots.

**Intelligent Tracking**  
Track upload status across platforms. Videos are only moved to the "sent" folder when uploaded to all requested platforms.

**Consistency for Creators**  
Keep your posting routine on track even when you are busy, traveling, or offline.

## Who Is It For?

Zelun Scheduler is ideal for:  
• Content creators who publish daily or multiple times per week  
• Gaming channels with large video batches  
• TikTok creators who record several short videos at once  
• Editors and managers who upload content for clients  
• Anyone who wants a simple, predictable posting routine without repeated manual uploads

## Why Use Zelun Scheduler?

Managing dozens of videos manually can become slow, repetitive, and prone to mistakes. Zelun Scheduler removes the bottleneck by providing an automated flow that handles uploads, scheduling, and organization in a single place.

You remain in full control of your publishing plan while the system takes care of the repetitive steps.

## Simple, Fast, and Reliable
