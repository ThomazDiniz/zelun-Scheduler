# Zelun Scheduler

The easiest way to schedule, automate, and manage bulk video uploads for YouTube and TikTok.

Zelun Scheduler is a streamlined tool designed to automate posting workflows for creators who work with large volumes of content. Instead of uploading every video manually, the platform allows you to upload, schedule, and organize multiple videos at once, giving you full control over publishing times and distribution.

Whether you manage several content batches per week or want a predictable publishing routine, Zelun Scheduler saves time and eliminates repetitive manual steps. The tool is built to be straightforward—no complex menus, no unnecessary clutter. Upload your videos, set the times, and let the system handle the rest.

## Key Features

**Bulk Uploads**  
Upload multiple videos at once and reduce the time wasted in uploading files one by one.

**Cross-Platform Scheduling**  
Schedule content for YouTube and TikTok using a single dashboard.

**Automated Publishing**  
Set the exact date and time for each video to go live, allowing you to plan days or weeks ahead.

**Content Organization**  
Group, queue, and reorder your videos easily to maintain a clear posting flow.

**Smart Queueing**  
Ensure that no video overlaps unintentionally by assigning automatic delays or day-by-day posting slots.

**Intelligent Tracking**

**Consistency for Creators**  
Keep your posting routine on track even when you are busy, traveling, or offline.
